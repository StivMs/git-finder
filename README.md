## Knowledge

A few things I've learned during this project:

* Better understanding of Hooks
* Using Routes with the <Link/> component that is used to navigate the different parts of the application.
* Using Context API - useContext and useReducer hooks for state management
* Better layout for components and file structure.
* Deploying to Netlify!
